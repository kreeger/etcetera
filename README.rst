ETCETERA: Educational Technology Center Equipment Tracking and Enhanced Report Authoring
========================================================================================

Purpose
-------

This is a web application for the Educational Technology Center at Missouri State University. It's designed to track and maintain all of our equipment, both for checkout and for installation.

The first phase of the project is to build the equipment database and the repair tracking system and bind the two together, and then build the checkout system on top of that, and eventually the cool whiz-bang reports.

Dependencies
------------

* `Django 1.1 or higher <http://www.djangoproject.com/download/>`_
* `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_
